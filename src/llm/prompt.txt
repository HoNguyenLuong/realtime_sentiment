You are performing sentiment analysis for a YouTube video using three sources of data: comments (text), audio, and video frames.

Each source has undergone individual sentiment analysis, and the summarized results are provided below:

1. **Text (YouTube Comments)**:
{text}

2. **Audio (Extracted from video)**:
{audio}

3. **Video Frames (Face/emotion detection)**:
{frames}

---

**Your Task:**

1. Combine all available sources (text, audio, frames) to determine the overall sentiment of the video.
2. If any source is missing, explain how the final result is affected and base your decision on the sources available.
3. The **sentiment score** must be a float between `-1` and `1`, where:
   - `-1` = strongly negative,
   - `0` = neutral,
   - `1` = strongly positive.
4. The **sentiment label** must be one of: `"positive"`, `"neutral"`, `"negative"`.
5. Provide a **confidence score** (0 to 1).
6. In your **description**, explain:
   - Which signals dominate (audio, text, or frames)
   - What emotions were most frequent
   - How many comments, frames, and audio chunks were analyzed ({num_comments} comments, {num_frames} frames, and {num_audio_chunks} audio chunks)
   - Why the final sentiment makes sense

**Your response must be in the following strict JSON format**:
```json
{
  "sentiment_score": 0.35,
  "sentiment_label": "positive",
  "confidence": 0.87,
  "description": "Out of {num_frames} analyzed frames and {num_audio_chunks} audio chunks, the dominant emotion was happiness and joy. Although no comment data was available, the visual and audio cues strongly indicate a positive experience. The analysis shows consistent smiling faces and excited tones in speech, suggesting the video content was positively received."
